Choose one of the login page styles you want to use as your baseline. For example, let's say you choose the 'Ice' style. Select the 'Ice' theme on the plugin settings page in Settings > Hide My Site > Select a theme for your login page. After you save changes, locate the associated php template file within the plugin subfolder called 'templates'. In this case, it would be the 'hmsice.php' file. Copy and paste this file directly into your theme folder. You can now edit the file as you please, and when you update the plugin in the future, you will not lose the changes you have made to the template. Note this feature is only available to premium users.
